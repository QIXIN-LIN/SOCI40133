# MACS60000: Computational Content Analysis (Course Notebooks)

This repository contains the **course notebooks** for **MACS60000: Computational Content Analysis**. These notebooks cover various computational methods and techniques for analyzing textual data, as explored during the course.

This repository is separate from my project repository and is solely focused on the lecture materials, exercises, and in-class examples provided throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

### Course Notebooks  
Each notebook corresponds to a specific week or topic covered during the course:  

1. **`1_Measuring_Meaning_and_Sampling.ipynb`**  
   - Introduction to measuring meaning in text data.  
   - Sampling strategies and understanding text distributions.

2. **`2_Counting_Words_&_Phrases_to_Trace_the_Distribution_of_Meaning.ipynb`**  
   - Word counting, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging.  
   - Exploring statistical distributions of words and phrases.

3. **`3_Topic_Modeling_and_Clustering.ipynb`**  
   - Introduction to topic modeling (e.g., LDA) and document clustering techniques.

4. **`4_Word_Embeddings.ipynb`**  
   - Building word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words.

5. **`5_Classifying_Meanings_and_Documents.ipynb`**  
   - Document classification and sentiment analysis.

6. **`6_Programming_Large_Language_Models_with_Language_Data.ipynb`**  
   - Using large language models (e.g., GPT) for tasks such as text generation and summarization.

7. **`7_Prediction_and_Causal_Inference.ipynb`**  
   - Combining text analysis with predictive modeling and causal inference.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:  
- A collection of **course notebooks** for hands-on learning and practice.  
- A reference for implementing computational methods in textual data analysis.  
- A resource for reviewing concepts introduced during the lectures.

**Note**: This repository does not include project-related materials, which are managed in a separate repository.

## Notes

- These notebooks reflect course content and my personal work during the course.  
- Some notebooks may include exploratory or incomplete code as part of the learning process.
